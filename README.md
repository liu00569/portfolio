# portfolio
I do not have so many portfolios to show, so I focus more on the color and layout.  I'm satisfied with the color combination. 

I changed the original design a little, I think it's better now.

I learn that use different media queries can make the website changes in a more natural way.

I didn't use anything which is not my own.
